  description: "Spider-Man 2 is a 2004 action-adventure video game, based on the film
    of the same name. Published by Activision, the console versions were developed
    by Treyarch, while the others had different developers and are drastically different
    as a result. The game is the sequel to Spider-Man (2002), itself based on the
    film of the same name. The Treyarch-developed versions are considered a landmark
    title in the industry for being the first superhero video game to incorporate
    a full open world design.\r\n\nKeyboard Supported, not Mac Supported.\n\nMade
    by Deaf, maintained by Jon.\n\nManual can be found at ktane.timwi.de or in the
    manuals folder of your game.\n\nIf there are any bugs, contact aGood_Usernam3#1518
    on Discord."
